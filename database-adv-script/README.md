## TABLE JOINS

Table joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

### Types of Joins

- **Inner Join**: Retrieves records with matching values in both tables.
- **Left Join**: Retrieves all records from the left table and matching records from the right table.
- **Right Join**: Retrieves all records from the right table and matching records from the left table.
- **Full Outer Join**: Retrieves records when there is a match in either table.
