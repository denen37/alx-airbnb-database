## TABLE JOINS

Table joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

### Types of Joins

- **Inner Join**: Retrieves records with matching values in both tables.
- **Left Join**: Retrieves all records from the left table and matching records from the right table.
- **Right Join**: Retrieves all records from the right table and matching records from the left table.
- **Full Outer Join**: Retrieves records when there is a match in either table.



## SUBQUERIES
- **Subqueries**: A query nested within another SQL query.
- **Correlated Subquery**: A subquery that references columns from the outer query.
- **Non-Correlated Subquery**: A subquery that runs independently of the outer query.

## AGGREGATIONS AND WINDOWS FUNCTIONS
- **Aggregations**: Use functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, and MIN to perform calculations on data sets.
- **Window Functions**: Perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row, such as ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and PARTITION BY.
